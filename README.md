  <ul>
    <li><code>task.js</code>: Defines the <code>Task</code> and <code>CreateProject</code> classes and exports the tasks and projects arrays.</li>
    <li><code>render.js</code>: Handles rendering tasks and projects, adding tasks and projects, and saving/loading data to/from local storage.</li>
    <li><code>dom.js</code>: Handles the dialog interactions for adding tasks and projects.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Local Storage</h2>
  <p>
    The application uses the browser's local storage to persist tasks and projects. The data is saved in JSON format under the keys <code>tasks</code> and <code>projects</code>.
  </p>

  <h2>Bugs</h2>
  <p>The "Mark Task as Completed" feature is not functioning as expected.</p>

  <h2>What I Learned</h2>
  <p>
    Through this project, I learned how to use ES6 modules and classes effectively. However, I recognize that there is room for improvement, particularly in making the codebase more modular and maintaining cleaner, more readable code.
